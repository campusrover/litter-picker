## Project Description
For our final project, we would like to create a litter collecting robot. This robot will move around the side of a specified area and periodically rotate itself to locate trash. If it spots trash, it will move toward the trash and collect it using an arm. Before returning to the original spot, It will try to look for more trash in the nearby area. If it does not spot any more trash, then it will return to its original path and continue to move through the area. This way we can reduce the number of repetitive trips from the original circulation path to the trash. When there is no more trash spotted or if there is too much trash collected (specified through a constant value set in the program), then it will go to a “trash collection” spot and empty the trash out.  

Through working on this project, we hope to learn how to use computer vision to allow the robot to navigate effectively, detect our desired objects, and determine the object’s orientation so that the robot can move toward it. This will be alongside utilizing SLAM to enhance the robot’s navigation and perception ability. We also wish to program an arm to be able to pick up objects effectively, and adjust itself in case of a failed attempt to pick up. Finally, we would also want to learn or discover good engineering practices that can help with workflow and collaboration. 
	
We would like to be evaluated on how well the robot is able to perform the specified task as well as the readability and documentation of our code.
